# Code coverage of tests

This directory contains a script which generates statistics
about the code coverage of the tests.

A call of `./run.sh` will compile all tests with code coverage
parameters and execute all tests to gather the information.


## Prerequisites 
    
  * The GCC utility [gcov][GCOV] has to be installed and
    `g++` has to be used as compiler.
  * The HTML output is generated by the [lcov][LCOV] tool.
